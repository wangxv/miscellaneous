        <p>Ramalinga as usual was walking into the Bhuvana Vijayam premises and the guards
            stopped him. He questioned why were they blocking the way. The soldiers told Ramalinga about the
            line and asked him to enter the premises only after reciting the first three lines for the last line they recited to him.
            Ramalinga boiled and trembled with anger on those soldiers.

        <p>Long before guards could understand the meaning of the poem, Ramalinga walked stiff into the main court hall.
            This state of affairs brought Ramalinga more close to Rayalu.
